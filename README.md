# RSA Key Generator and Encryption tool

- This is a program which uses **RSA Cryptosystem** to generate 1024 bit keys and encrypt texts.

- It requires **Java 8** or higher.

## What is RSA Cryptosystem?

- [RSA Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and widely used for data 
transmissions. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem". The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978.
